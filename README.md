# StudySpace ðŸ§ 

StudySpace is a social networking-based platform for the purpose of gathering individuals from the same areas of study or same class across the whole internet. They do not have to come from the same school or the same city, but they belong in the same community because of the class they are currently enrolled in. It's a place where people can motivate each other, answer each's questions, seek help from others, and even do work together virtually. It's a perfect application to boost one's productivity, learning experience, and make new friends.
